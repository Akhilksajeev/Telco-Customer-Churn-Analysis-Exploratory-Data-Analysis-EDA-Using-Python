# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Using-Python


This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of telco customers to understand the factors influencing customer churn. By utilizing Python libraries, the analysis aims to uncover insights into customer behavior and characteristics that contribute to churn rates.

Dataset
The dataset, titled "Telco Customer Churn," contains various attributes related to customer demographics, services subscribed, monthly and total charges, and whether the customer has churned. Key columns include:

Customer Demographics: Gender, Senior Citizen status, age group.
Service Usage: Type of Internet Service, subscriptions to additional services (e.g., Online Security, Device Protection).
Billing Information: Monthly Charges, Total Charges, Contract type, Payment Method.
Churn Status: A binary indicator of whether the customer has churned.
Key Features
Churn Distribution: A pie chart visualizing the overall churn rate among customers.
Churn Rate Analysis: Stacked bar charts showing churn rates segmented by gender, age group (senior citizens), contract type, payment method, and various service subscriptions.
Monthly and Total Charges: Boxplots and bar charts comparing average charges for churned vs. non-churned customers.
Correlation Analysis: A heatmap displaying correlations between numerical features, highlighting relationships between charges, tenure, and churn rates.
Tenure Impact: Analysis of how customer tenure affects churn rate over time, plotted as a line chart.
Offer Analysis: Evaluation of churn rates based on different promotional offers provided to customers.
Visual Insights: Additional visualizations, including scatter plots for monthly vs. total charges and histograms showing the distribution of customer tenure.
